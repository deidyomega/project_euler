# Project Euler

This is a master project for learning different languages using project euler.

If you are reading this, I strongly recommend you *don't* view the source code prior to solving any of the puzzles.
You are losing the fun of it that way!

Code should be pretty orderly:

* Lang/
	* problem_x.ext (or problem_x/something.ext)
	* virtual container - venv, node_modules, etc -- whatever language specific package isolation, following language best practice (after installing them)
	* README.md -- this will contain tips on how to run all the programs in general and install notes
	* run -- this will be the easiest way to run a problem ( ./run problem_1 will usually do all the steps needed to run problem 1 )

### Progress:

2. C#: 60% - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
3. fortran: 40% - 1, 2, 9, 10
4. go: 100% - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
5. java: 0%
6. python: 100% - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
7. r: 0%
8. ruby: 40% - 1, 2, 4, 5
